## Introduction

Here we provide everything you need to migrate from previous versions of RSS3 Network Data Sublayer (DSL), to the latest decentralized version (DSL v1.0).

The fundamentals have not changed: 

**Developers are able to access billion pieces of Open Information, aggregated from different sources, through one unified interface, in one structured format.**

We provide the motivations behind this migration, and list all the changes, so that your migration can be smooth and your innovation continues.

If in doubt, always refer to:

## Motivation

In 2022, we shipped the DSL v0.4, a version aimed to provide comprehensive Web3 Open Information coverage while maintaining high performance. It also served as a proof of concept for future decentralization. An advanced caching mechanism was employed to improve its performance, while handling the complicated data structuring logic in real-time. This is commonly known as the Pull architecture.

However, as the Web3 landscape has seen a drastic shift, our Pull architecture needs an upgrade. With the increase in data structure diversity (or fragmentation) , data volume indexed, and requests served, we began redesigning the architecture and conducting experiments to further optimize performance while reducing operational costs.

The DSL v1.0 has been rebuilt from scratch using a Push architecture, inheriting the merits of v0.4, and offers a solution that combines ultrafast structuring performance with a scalable coverage of Open Information. Not only that, it was designed with decentralization in mind.

The latest DSL is fully decentralized, supported by over 80 RSS3 Nodes (at the time of writing) constantly structuring Open Information on the RSS3 Network:

- Data structuring is done by RSS3 Nodes scattered across the globe.
- Requests are routed through RSS3 Global Indexers and relayed to the most suitable RSS3 Nodes based on coverage and reliability.

**While seemingly impossible, this decentralized version is actually more performant than its predecessor, with reduced operational costs for RSS3 Node Operators.**

### Sunset Date

We are advocating for the adoption of this fully decentralized architecture. DSL v1.0 will fully replace v0.4 on 30 July 2024, with all previous versions **deprecated and discontinued on 13 August 2024** (All times are in UTC).

### Migration

Since we do not track service usage, we are unable to notify all developers. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. To assist with the transition, we have provided a detailed migration guide.
