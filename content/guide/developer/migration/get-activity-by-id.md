title: Get Activity by ID
---

## API Changes

GET `/tx/{hash}` -> GET `/decentralized/tx/{id}`

The new endpoint not only changes the URL but also revises the request parameters to facilitate more detailed and structured requests. This change aims to enhance functionality and specificity in querying Open Information in a decentralized manner.
