title: Get Activities by Platform
---

## API Changes

GET `/platforms/notes/{platform}` -> GET `/decentralized/platform/{platform}`

Both endpoints serve the same purpose: to retrieve a list of activities from a specified decentralized platform. Previously, the request parameters were limited. The new version offers enhanced parameters and filtering options to improve usability and performance.

The updated endpoint includes more detailed filtering options such as timestamps, success status, and activity direction, ensuring more efficient and flexible retrieval of Open Information. This change reflects the need for more comprehensive data retrieval on the Open Web.
