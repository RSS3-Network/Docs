## Prerequisite

These guides are designed for developers of all experience levels. For beginners, you will need:

1. Basic terminal knowledge, and
2. cURL installed on your machine, or an HTTP client to send HTTP requests, such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) and [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/). You may even use our interactive API Reference to get started: https://docs.rss3.io/guide/developer/api
