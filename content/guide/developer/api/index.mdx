title: RSS3 Data Sublayer API
description: >-
  On the RSS3 Network, Global Indexers (GIs) are responsible for facilitating
  coordination among RSS3 Nodes, engaging with the Value Sublayer (VSL) and
  performing critical functions such as Network Rewards calculation and slashing
  enforcement. Global Indexers also provide Data Sublayer (DSL) API to process
  data queries and offer the Networkâ€™s insight via the Network Transparency API
  (NTA).
