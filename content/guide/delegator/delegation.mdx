## Introduction

Delegation is a way to support Node Operators and thus boost the RSS3 Network's stability and resilience.

There are two types of Nodes you can delegate to:

1. For a normal Node, you can stake your RSS3 tokens to support the Node and earn rewards.
1. For a [Public Good Node](guide/core/concepts/node/public-good-node), you can entrust your RSS3 tokens to support the Node's operation. You may receive fewer rewards,  support initiatives and clauses that are oriented towards Public Goods.

Before performing a delegation, make sure you have enough RSS3 tokens on VSL to cover the delegation amount and the gas fee.

## Choose a Node

The [Explorer](https://explorer.rss3.io/nodes) is where you can find all the Nodes.
You may choose a Node to delegate to based on its pool size, historical performance, reputation, and other factors.
