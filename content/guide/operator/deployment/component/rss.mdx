## Introduction

RSS is a web feed that allows users to access updates to online content in a standardized format.

It is often preceived as the first decentralized web protocol, given its open and permissionless nature,

RSS3 Node has an RSS component that indexes data from RSS feeds, enabling users to access and interact with the data in the RSS3 ecosystem.

## Deployment

This guide assumes you have already deployed an RSS3 Node and are familiar with the deployment process.
If not, refer to the [Deployment Guide](/guide/operator/deployment/guide) for detailed instructions.

### Hardware Requirements

The support for RSS feeds in RSS3 Node is achieved through RSSHub, which is a lightweight and efficient RSS feed generator.
Thus, it does not increase the CPU or memory usage of your Node significantly.
As the feeds are generated on-the-fly, the storage space required is also minimal.

### Sample config.yaml

There is a new section under `component` for the RSS component, which looks like this:

```yaml
environment: production

# the rest of the config...

endpoints:
  # the rest of the config...
  rsshub:
    # `url` is the public URL which points to an RSSHub instance
    url: https://your.rsshub.instance

component:
  # the rest of the config...

  # `rss` component includes workers indexing data from federated networks conforming to ActivityPub protocol, such as Mastodon, Misskey, and Threads.
  rss:
      # `id` is a unique identifier for the worker.
    - id: rsshub-core
      # `network` is the network that the worker is indexing from.
      network: rsshub
      # `endpoint` is defined in the `endpoints` section above.
      endpoint: rsshub
      worker: core
      # `parameters` includes specific settings for the rsshub-core worker.
        parameters:
          authentication:
            access_key: your-access-key

# the rest of the config...

```

## Conclusion

In this guide, we introduced the RSS component and provided a sample configuration for deploying it.

By adding an RSS component to your RSS3 Node, you can seamlessly integrate data from RSS feeds into your Node, expanding its coverage and utility of your Node.
This may increase your Node's visibility and attract more requests, enhancing your Node's reputation and potential operation rewards.
