## Introduction

RSS3 AgentData is a robust ecosystem of APIs designed to deliver high-fidelity, real-time information streams tailored for AI agents. This data is sourced from a decentralized network of over 90 RSS3 Nodes, which ensures high availability and reliability, as well as a diverse set of inputs from multiple sources, including trending topics, social insights, news, and more. By leveraging this data, AI agents can make contextually relevant decisions, refine their models, and stay current with the latest trends.

RSS3 Node has an AI component that indexes data from AgentData ecosystem, enabling users to access and interact with the data in the RSS3 ecosystem.

## Deployment

This guide assumes you have already deployed an RSS3 Node and are familiar with the deployment process.
If not, refer to the [Deployment Guide](/guide/operator/deployment/guide) for detailed instructions.

### Hardware Requirements

The support for AI in RSS3 Node is achieved through AgentData ecosystem, which is a lightweight and efficient AI data generator.
Thus, it does not increase the CPU or memory usage of your Node significantly.
As the feeds are generated on-the-fly, the storage space required is also minimal.

### Sample config.yaml

There is a new section under `component` for the AI component, which looks like this:

```yaml
environment: production

# the rest of the config...

component:
  # the rest of the config...

  # `ai` type includes the worker indexing data in AI format.
  ai:
    id: agentdata-core
    worker: core
    endpoint: https://your.agentdata.com/
    parameters:
      agentdata_db_url:
      openai_api_key:
      ollama_host:
      kaito_api_token:
      twitter:
        bearer_token:
        api_key:
        api_secret:
        access_token:
        access_token_secret:

# the rest of the config...

```

## Conclusion

In this guide, we introduced the AI component and provided a sample configuration for deploying it.

By adding an AI component to your RSS3 Node, you can seamlessly integrate data from AgentData ecosystem into your Node, expanding its coverage and utility of your Node.
This may increase your Node's visibility and attract more requests, enhancing your Node's reputation and potential operation rewards.
