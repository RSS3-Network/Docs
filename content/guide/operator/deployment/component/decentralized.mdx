## Introduction

Decentralized networks often comprise of permissionless and open systems that enable users to interact and share data without relying on centralized authorities.

These network often provide users with greater control over their data and privacy, making them an attractive alternative to traditional centralized systems.

RSS3 Node has a Decentralized component that indexes data from decentralized networks, enabling users to access and interact with the data in the RSS3 ecosystem.

## Deployment

This guide assumes you have already deployed an RSS3 Node and are familiar with the deployment process.
If not, refer to the [Deployment Guide](/guide/operator/deployment/guide) for detailed instructions.

### Hardware Requirements

The support for decentralized networks requires additional resources (mainly storage capacity) which grows with the number of networks covered and the volume of data they generate.

Adding more workers will increase the CPU and memory usage of your Node, monitor your Node closely to ensure it has sufficient resources to support the Federated componentâ€™s data requirements.

### Sample config.yaml

There is a new section under `component` for the Decentralized component, which looks like this:

```yaml
environment: production

# the rest of the config...

endpoints:
  # the rest of the config...
  endpoints:
    vsl:
      # `url` is the RPC (or any data fetching service) URL for the corresponding decentralized network.
      url: https://rpc.rss3.io

component:
  # the rest of the config...

  # `decentralized` component includes workers indexing data from decentralized networks such as blockchain networks, Arweave, etc.
  decentralized:
    # Each configuration here initializes a worker.
    # `id` is the unique identifier
    - id: vsl-core
      # `network` is the network that the worker is indexing from.
      network: vsl
      # `endpoint` is the data access endpoint used by the worker.
      # You can reference the endpoint defined above in the `endpoints` section.
      # You can also use a direct URL, such as `https://rpc.rss3.io`.
      endpoint: vsl
      # `worker` is the actual worker that processes the data.
      # You can find the list of available workers here: https://github.com/RSS3-Network/Node/blob/develop/README.md#supported-networks-and-workers.
      worker: core

# the rest of the config...

```

## Conclusion

In this guide, we introduced the Decentralized component and provided a sample configuration for deploying it.

By adding a Decentralized component to your RSS3 Node, you can seamlessly integrate data from decentralized networks into your Node, expanding its coverage and utility of your Node.
This may increase your Node's visibility and attract more requests, enhancing your Node's reputation and potential operation rewards.
