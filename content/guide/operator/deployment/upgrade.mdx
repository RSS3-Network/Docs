# Upgrading Your Node

Maintaining an up-to-date Node is crucial for optimal performance and security.
We recommend regularly checking the [Changelog](https://github.com/RSS3-Network/Node/releases) for updates and new features.

<Callout type="info">
When upgrading, ensure that you update your `config.yaml` file or modify the configurations in accordance with the latest [Deployment Guide](https://docs.rss3.io/guide/operator/deployment/guide#configuration-options).
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
Before proceeding with any upgrade, carefully review the release notes, particularly for major version changes.
Major versions may introduce breaking changes that require additional steps or modifications.
</Callout>

## Upgrade to v2.0.x

When upgrading from v1.2.x or older versions to v2.0.x, it is now possible to include a new `ai` component.
Update your `config.yaml` file as follows:

```diff
component:
+++    ai:
+++      - id: agentdata-core
+++        worker: core
+++        endpoint: https://your.agentdata.com/
+++        parameters:
+++          agentdata_db_url:
+++          openai_api_key:
+++          ollama_host:
+++          kaito_api_token:
+++          twitter:
+++            bearer_token:
+++            api_key:
+++            api_secret:
+++            access_token:
+++            access_token_secret:
```

Pull and start the latest container image after updating the `config.yaml` file.

### Automated Deployer

For operators using the automated deployer, the process is simple:

1. Update your `config.yaml` file in the `config/` directory.
2. Execute the following command in the same directory as your existing `docker-compose.yaml` file to initiate the automated upgrade process:

    ```shell
    curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RSS3-Network/Node-Automated-Deployer/main/automated_deploy.sh | bash
    ```

This command will automatically upgrade all necessary components of your Node.
