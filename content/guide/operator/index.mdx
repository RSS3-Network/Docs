## Introduction

This section provides a comprehensive guide for all DSL Node Operators.
It covers the deployment, configuration, and maintenance of an RSS3 Node.

## Logical Hierarchy

### Component

An RSS3 Node may consist of the following components:
1. Decentralized: indexes data from decentralized networks and protocols. like blockchains.
1. Federated: indexes data from federated networks and protocols. like ActivityPub.
1. RSS: indexes data from sources adhering to the RSS specification, like RSSHub.

<Callout type="warn">You must enable at least one of the above components during the deployment.</Callout>

### Worker

Each component may have multiple workers.
A worker is the most basic unit of a Node that includes a set of logics to index, structure, and store Open Information.

For the list of available workers, see:

<Callout type="warn">You must enable at least one worker during the deployment.</Callout>

## Node Deployment

Although the RSS3 Node is a complex system, we have streamlined the deployment process to make it as simple and accessible as possible.

And we offer alternative deployment methods:

## Node State

Managing your Node's state is crucial for maintaining its performance and stability, and thus ensuring the quality of the entire RSS3 Network.
Your Node's state is directly related to the amount of network rewards you receive.

## Node Status

You can view your Node's status, including its coverage and rewards, on the RSS3 Network Explorer.
