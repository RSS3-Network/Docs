## Architecture

A Global Indexer (GI) is responsible for facilitating coordination among Nodes and engaging with the VSL. The GI performs critical duties to ensure the Network is robust and reliable.

The operation of a GI is subject to a set of requirements set by the Network and approvals from the Community.

## What a GI does

A GI has many duties to perform.

### Broadcaster

The broadcaster constantly monitors all Nodes’ status for irregular behaviors. It works closely with the broadcaster and router to ensure the Network’s stability.

### Enforcer

The enforcer works with the broadcaster and router to maintain a record of demotion and slashing. Learn more about these concepts:

</Cards>

### Indexer

The indexer is responsible for structuring activities that take place on the entire Network, and supplying the information via the Network Transparency API (NTA):

### Payment Processor

The payment processor (works together with the settler) ensures that requests fee collected are correctly distributed to the corresponding Nodes and creators. Learn more:

### Router

GIs are equipped with more computational power to work out the optimal route to process incoming requests. A request retrieves Open Information from a Node and frequently from a group of Nodes simultaneously.

The router ensures requests are routed and served in high performance with minimal latency.

### Settler

The settler initiates submissions of work records to the VSL, and the settlement contract will verify and distribute network reward. Learn more about the reward:

### Taxer

The taxer works out the Network’s average tax rate and updates the settlement contract on the VSL. Learn why this is needed:

## Open Source

The code base is publicly available as open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/RSS3-Network/Global-Indexer).
