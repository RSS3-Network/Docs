description: The coverage of a Node.

## Introduction

The combination of workers and the coverage period specified, together form the Node’s coverage. Each Node can have a custom coverage to encourage diversity and promote a healthy and stable Network.

## Worker

A Node’s coverage is supported by workers that index, structure, and store Open Information from Open Data Protocols. Learn more about these concepts:

## Coverage Period

In addition, each Node may choose to cover different coverage periods, starting from 3 months. It is unrealistic to cover each worker from its inception, as it would waste significant disk space and other resources, leading to higher operational costs.

<Callout>
  The default coverage period is set to 3 months, this can be overridden by an environment variable.
