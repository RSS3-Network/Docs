description: Empower individuals with greater control over their assets and data.

The proclaimed right to free speech is protected by many laws, but the economic benefits derived from the underlying assets and data are often overlooked.

High-quality information is what enables generational knowledge to be passed on, and ensures the human race prosper for millenniums to come (hopefully). An fair and transparent Ownership Economy is often regarded as one of the economic models to promote creation of high-quality information.

Fostering a sustainable Ownership Economy has never been easy, despite attempts by visionaries like Aaron Swartz and Tim Berners-Lee. While seemingly impossible, we should never give up and allow our valuable digital commodity, community, and their underlying rights to be eroded.

RSS3 aims to promote a sustainable Ownership Economy.

> A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. — Lao Tzu

And we have taken a small step forward by creating the RSS3 Network.

Specifically, the creation of our novel dual-layer architecture is precisely to provide an environment for a sustainable Ownership Economy:

- The DSL fosters a user- and developer-friendly environment for innovations to happen.
- The VSL reward all network participants fairly and transparently.

**In an Ownership Economy, it does not have to be a zero-sum game, and no one has to lose out.**
