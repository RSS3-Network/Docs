# Open Source Commitment

Open source is what powers the digital world we live in today.

At RSS3, we proudly open source everything we work on, and that is what enables us to grow.

# Open Source Stack

With our commitment to open source, we prioritize using open source solutions whenever possible. This approach ensures our work is efficient, adaptable, and free from licensing constraints.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of open source solutions we use to build the RSS3 Network. Without them, achieving the current performance, or even delivering anything usable, would have been impossible:

- [Biome](https://github.com/biomejs/biome)
- [echo](https://github.com/labstack/echo)
- [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum)
- [gorm](https://gorm.io/)
- [LangChain](https://langchain.com/)
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)
- [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/)
- [rueidis](https://github.com/redis/rueidis)
- [turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs)
- [zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap)

And many others. Thank you all ðŸŽ‰ !
