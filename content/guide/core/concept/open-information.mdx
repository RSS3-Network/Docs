# The Impact of Closed Information on Technology and Society

Picture a scenario where as a developer or analyst you need some information to build a project and you could not access data on networks because of processes, inter-platform, or institutional barriers even though the data you seek exists and because of this, you have to pull the plug on the project which also ends whatever good could have come out of it.

As a developer or analyst, imagine needing specific data for a project but being unable to access it due to network restrictions, institutional barriers, or platform limitations. Despite existing data and tools like freedom of information laws, closed information still poses significant challenges, often driven by big tech companies to maintain monopolies and suppress competition.
