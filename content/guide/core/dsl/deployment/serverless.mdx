## Introduction

RSS3 Node has a [light mode](/guide/core/dsl/deployment/light-mode) that enables its deployment on serverless platforms such as Zeabur, Railway, etc.

This guide uses Zeabur and Railway as examples to provide step-by-step instructions to deploy a Light Node using templates provided by the Community.

## Before proceeding to the deployment, make sure you have the following ready:

- A balance of **10,000 RSS3** on RSS3 VSL, to be used as the deposit for a Normal Node, unless you are operating a Public Good Node.
- Sufficient RSS3 tokens to cover gas fees.
- If deploy on Zeabur, it requires at least the [Developer Plan](https://zeabur.com/pricing).
- If deploy on Railway, it requires at least the [Pro Plan](https://railway.app/pricing).

Please notice that:

- You can bridge RSS3 tokens from Ethereum Mainnet to VSL using the bridge .
- Transactions on VSL require RSS3 to cover gas fees. It is recommended to bridge extra tokens, such as 10,010 RSS3 , to cover both the deposit and gas fees.

## Step 1: Wallet Connection

To prepare your wallet for deployment, ensure you have enough RSS3 tokens (such as 10,010) on VSL. This step is crucial for registering your Node and covering gas fees during deployment.

To connect to RSS3 Explorer and register a new Node, follow these steps:

1. Visit the Explorer at https://explorer.rss3.io/
2. Click on the "Connect Wallet" button at the top right corner of the page.
3. Choose your preferred wallet provider (e.g., MetaMask) and complete the connection process.

## Step 2: Node Registration

Once connected, navigate to the "Node" page to begin your registration.

Follow the prompt to provide the required information to complete the registration process. Once completed, you can proceed to the deployment, which we'll cover in the next step.

3. Deploy the Node on Zeabur

   During the deployment, all required information should be automatically filled. When necessary, please update the endpoint settings and select a suitable region for your Node.
