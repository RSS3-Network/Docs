RSS3 is a community-driven project, this means that all decisions are collectively made by the community on the forum:

https://forum.rss3.io

All changes are firstly proposed on the forum, and later transitioned into the RSS3 Evolution Proposals (REPs), and collectively approved by the community.

  All historical and ongoing REPs are available at: https://github.com/RSS3-Network/REPs
