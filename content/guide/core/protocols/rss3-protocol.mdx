# Introduction

The RSS3 Protocol aims to structure Open Information for interoperability.

Open Information, indexed from multiple open data protocols (ODPs), is structured by RSS3 Nodes into the Protocol format for interoperability.

ODPs use different data structures; Within an ODP, there might be multiple products, services, and protocols that leverage different data structures to suit their needs. This lack of standardization means limited interoperability, limiting the creation of scalable applications.

The Protocol addresses this issue by offering a unified set of data structures that serve as an abstraction. This abstraction simplifies the integration process, making it more manageable and scalable for developers to work with data across various ODPs.

# Implementation

The detailed Protocol schema is available:

The Protocol serves as the foundation of the Data Sublayer, enabling Open Information to be interoperable for powering innovative applications such as AI.

Currently, implementations include:

Go : https://github.com/RSS3-Network/Protocol-Go

JavaScript/TypeScript : via the SDK https://github.com/RSS3-Network/DSL-js-sdk

Python : https://github.com/RSS3-Network/DSL-python-sdk/tree/main/rss3_dsl_sdk/schemas
