## Introduction

A chip is an ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token (NFT) representing a network participantâ€™s stake in a particular Node.

## Minting

When a network participant stakes or entrusts tokens to a Node, the participant automatically receives a chip.

## Redemption

A chip can be redeemed for its underlying staked or entrusted tokens at any time, subject to a waiting period imposed by the Network.
