Slashing is a mechanism used to maintain network stability.

<Callout type="error">
  Currently, the slashing mechanism is still in its design stage. An REP is required to approve the final design before implementation.
</Callout>

A Node is slashed when its [demotion](./demotion) counter reaches 4.

## Consequences

A slashed Node faces many consequences.

### [Reliability Score](./reliability-score)

The Node’s score is set to 0. This effectively means that the Node will not receive any requests during the current Epoch.

### Staking Pool

0.5% of tokens in the Node’s [Staking Pool](../pool/staking-pool) will be temporarily put into the Slashing Pool.

### Operation Pool

1% of tokens in the Node’s [Operation Pool](../pool/operation-pool) will be temporarily put into the Slashing Pool. Learn more about Operation Pool:

### Node Stage

The Node is put into the `Offline` stage, which means it will not enter subsequent Epochs and resume operation, unless the Operator manually confirms that it is ready.

## Challenge

There will be a 3-Epoch challenge window during which the Operator can challenge a slash. Each challenge will undergo a manual review. A successful challenge revokes the slash and returns all tokens from the Slashing Pool. However, lost opportunities, such as network rewards, will not be distributed retrospectively.

## Committed Slash

Failing to revoke a slash within the challenge window means that the slash will be committed permanently. The slashed tokens will be:

### Burned

50% of the slashed tokens will be burned.

## Reward and Reimbursement

20% of the slashed tokens will be awarded to reporters. When the slash is automatically triggered without a reporter, 20% of the slashed tokens will be reimbursed to all developers who paid [request fees](./request-fee) during the Epoch in which the slashing occurred.

## Donation

The remaining tokens will be donated to the Treasury and used for [Public Good](/guide/core/concepts/nodes/public-good-node) initiatives and clauses.
