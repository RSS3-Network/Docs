Demotion is a mechanism designed to maintain network stability.

<Callout type="error">
  Currently, the demotion mechanism is still in its design stage. An REP is required to approve the final design before implementation.
</Callout>

Each Node has a Demotion counter which records the number of times it has behaved unexpectedly. This includes but is not limited to:

1. Failed to maintain a healthy online state.
2. Failed to process a request.
3. Processed a request with an incorrect response.

Each increase in the counter drastically reduces the Nodeâ€™s [Reliability Score](/guide/core/concepts/fee-and-calculation/reliability-score).

When the Demotion counter reaches the threshold imposed by the Network, the Node is [slashed](/guide/core/concepts/fee-and-calculation/slashing).

<Callout>
  Currently, the threshold is designed to be 4.
