The operation tax is a rate set by the Node Operator of a Normal Node, and is applied to the staking reward allocated to its Staking Pool. Unless itâ€™s a [Public Good Node](../node/public-good-node), in which the rules are different.

The amount of tax collectible by a Node, is capped at a maximum of 25 times the amount of the current size of its Operation Pool.

The tax is collected from the reward received by the Node.

The taxation happens at the end of each Epoch.
