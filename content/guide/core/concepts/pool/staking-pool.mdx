A Staking Pool is used to store staked tokens for a Normal Node. Unless it’s a [Public Good Node](/guide/core/concepts/node/public-good-node), in which the rules are different.

Network participants can stake tokens into a Normal Node’s Staking Pool to increase the Node’s chance to receive requests, therefore boosting its chance to receive requests to maximize its earning of request fee and network reward.

In the event of malicious behavior by the Node, the Staking Pool is slashed, see:
