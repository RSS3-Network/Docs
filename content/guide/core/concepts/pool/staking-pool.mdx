A Staking Pool is used to store staked tokens for a Normal Node. Unless it’s a [Public Good Node](/guide/core/concepts/node/public-good-node), in which the rules are different.

Network participants can stake tokens into a Normal Node’s Staking Pool to increase the Node’s chance to receive requests, therefore boosting its chance to receive requests to maximize its earning of request fee and network reward.

A Staking Pool may be subject to the operation tax, see:

In the event of malicious behavior by the Node, the Staking Pool is slashed, see:
