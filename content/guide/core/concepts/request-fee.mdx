description: Learn how request fee are calculated and distributed.

For all requests processed by Nodes on the DSL, developers pay a fee in $RSS3.


<Callout type="error">
  Currently, all requests are free of charge, we expect this to change soon. An REP is required before implementation.
</Callout>

100% of the request fee go to Node Operators and owners of the information requested.

<Callout>
  The distribution among Node Operators and owners is designed to follow a ratio to be proposed in an REP.
</Callout>

This model aims to promote an [Ownership Economy](/guide/core/ownership-economy).

The amount of request fee, which directly reflects the work rate of a Node, has a very important impact on the final [network reward](./operation/network-reward) received by the Node.
