## Introduction

A Public Good Node is a Node that operates for Public Goods provision.
It differs from a normal Node in the following ways:

- Instead of receiving operation reward and request fee, these Node Operators donate all the proceedings to support initiatives and clauses that are oriented towards Public Goods.
- Instead of having a Staking Pool, all Public Good Nodes share a Public Good Pool, which is used to store tokens entrusted by the participants.
- Instead of having an Operator-set operation tax, Public Good Nodes' operation tax is the average tax rate of the Network.
