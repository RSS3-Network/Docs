## Introduction

All the data and metrics of the Network should and must be openly accessible.

The network transparency API (NTA) enables a decentralized and permissionless way for anyone to analyze how the RSS3 Network is performing.

## Scope

Currently, the scope includes the following areas (and will get broadened as the Network evolves)

1. Liquidity-related information such as bridging and (un)staking
1. Operation-related information such as work records of all RSS3 Nodes
1. Network rewards-related information such as distribution records
1. Slashing-related information
1. Fees-related information such as request fees generated
1. Tax-related information such as the current average tax rate

## Access

You can access the API now via the [RSS3 Data Sublayer API](/guide/developer/api).
