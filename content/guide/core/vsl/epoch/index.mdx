## Introduction

An Epoch is a period of time used as a reference to measure the RSS3 Network’s operation, during which the Network’s parameters are fixed.

Currently, each Epoch is set to 18 hours long.

## Life Cycle

### Start of an Epoch

At the beginning of each Epoch, updates such as changes to the parameters take effect. This may include but not limited to:

1. Requirements for operating a Node, such as coverage.
2. Network reward adjustment.
3. Request fee adjustment.
4. Global Indexer distribution algorithm.

Many other parameters might also change. Major changes must undergo the REP process, whereas minor changes are announced at least 3 Epochs before taking effect, giving Node Operators sufficient time to respond.

### During an Epoch

During each Epoch, the Network functions automatically and reacts to many events. This may include but not limited to:

1. Node status verification.
2. Node reliability verification.
3. Request distribution.

### End of an Epoch

At the end of each Epoch, many operations happen automatically. This may include but not limited to:

1. Distribution of network reward.
2. Settlement of request fee.
3. Enforcement of slashes.
4. Taxation.
