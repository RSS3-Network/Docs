## Compatible Models

Learn what models are compatible with OpenAgent.

OpenAgent is compatible with many models out of the box.

We rate the performance by conducting various tests and manually reviewing the output. These performance ratings give a **rough indication** of how well the model can handle queries involving Open Web elements like blockchain, but they **do not** reflect the overall capability of the model.

For more information on what's included by the Open Web, see:
