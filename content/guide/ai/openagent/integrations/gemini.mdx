## Introduction

OpenAgent is able to bootstrap your development with native Google Gemini API support.

An API key from Google Gemini is required, get your API key directly from Google: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey .

After obtaining your API key, simply put it in your OpenAgent .env file, and you are good to go.

For Google Cloud users, consider using Google Vertex AI to streamline your deployment:
