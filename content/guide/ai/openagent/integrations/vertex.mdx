> Google Vertex AI is available with Google Cloud. For non-Google Cloud developers, we recommend using [Google Gemini](/guide/ai/openagent/integrations/gemini) instead.

## Introduction

OpenAgent is able to bootstrap your development with native Google Vertex AI support.

In this guide, we assume that you have adequate knowledge about Google Cloud, and your OpenAgent is deployed on Google Cloud.

## Steps

### Create a Google Cloud Vertex AI Project

Follow this guide to create a Google Cloud Vertex AI Project: https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/cloud-environment .

Upon successful creation of your project, take note of your project_id, as it is required in your OpenAgent .env file.

### Create a Service Account with Vertex AI Access

Follow this guide to create a service account: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create .

Upon successful creation of your service account, make sure that it has one of the following roles:

- [Vertex AI User (recommended)](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/general/access-control#aiplatform.user)
- [Vertex AI Administrator (full access to resources)](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/general/access-control#aiplatform.admin)

### Authenticate to Vertex AI

When deploying on Google Cloud, your OpenAgent is automatically authenticated to access Vertex AI.

Follow this guide to authenticate OpenAgent with Vertex AI: https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/authentication .
