## Introduction

While Chainlit provides a chatbot-style GUI for interacting with OpenAgent, you can integrate OpenAgent into your apps programmatically.

## API Integration

The fastest way to do so is by invoking OpenAgent’s APIs. OpenAgent is built with amazing open source libraries, it leverages FastAPI as its HTTP server, which provides native support for OpenAPI documentation.
