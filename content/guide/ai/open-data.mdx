## Introduction

Open Data has always been the cornerstone of innovation.
GPT (and all other LLMs) wouldn’t exist without the freely available corpus of Open Data on the Internet.

Unfortunately, Open Data is becoming increasingly scarce, as more platforms build paywalls or restrict access to user-generated content.
It has always be RSS3's aim to provide permissionless access to Open Information to all, this includes AI researchers and developers.

## Motivation

Diverse data is crucial for creating AI systems that can truly understand and respond to a wide range of perspectives.
Data on the RSS3 Network is sourced from decentralized and permissionless sources, collectively indexed by over 80 RSS3 Nodes distributed globally.
The data provides the much-needed diversity by capturing a broader spectrum of user interactions and social dynamics, unlike traditional, limited datasets.

Accessing the data is already straightforward via the RSS3 Network, but we want to make it even easier for AI researchers and developers.
Instead of making loads of RESTful API calls to the RSS3 Network, we are providing high-quality, structured and pre-processed datasets that can be directly used for many machine learning tasks.

## List of Datasets

We are continouslly working on creating and releasing new datasets.
Please check back often for updates.

### Hugging Face - A High Quality Open Web Content Dataset

[This dataset on HF](https://huggingface.co/datasets/RSS3-Network/high_quality_open_web_content) is specifically optimized for machine learning tasks, making it straightforward to parse, transform, and analyze.

It contains **over 11 million posts**  from various decentralized sources, including Farcaster, Lens, and more. Internally, we have been fine-tuning Llama and Gemma with this dataset.

Here’s what you’ll find in the dataset:

1. handle: The author’s handle on the corresponding platform (e.g., Farcaster, Lens).
1. body: The main text content of the post.
1. media: A list of media objects linked to the post.
   1. address: The URL where the media is hosted.
   1. mime_type: The MIME type of the media (e.g., image/jpeg, video/mp4).
1. profile_id: The profile identifier of the author on the platform.
1. publication_id: The unique identifier for the post on the corresponding platform.
1. timestamp: The time the post was published or, if not available, the time when it was indexed by RSS3 Nodes.


## Conclusion

We are excited to see what you can build with the data.
