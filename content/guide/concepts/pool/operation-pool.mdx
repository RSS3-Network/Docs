Each Node has an Operation Pool that is used to store tokens that are allocated to a Normal Node from two sources:

- [Request Fee](/guide/concepts/fee-and-calculation/request-fee): collected from requests served on the DSL.
- [Operation Tax](/guide/concepts/fee-and-calculation/operation-tax): collected from the staking reward received by the Node’s Staking Pool.

The Operation Pool also stores the Operator’s initial deposit. In the event of malicious behavior by the Node, the Operation Pool including its deposit, is slashed, see [Slashing Fee](/guide/concepts/fee-and-calculation/slash-fee).
