description: Learn how the reliability score affects a Node.
---

A Global Indexer routes requests to Nodes based on their coverage and reliability score. The calculation of the score is based on a range of factors, including but not limited to:

1. Nodeâ€™s uptime
2. Requests processed (total and within current Epoch)
3. Slash records
4. Operation deposit
5. Operation Pool size
6. Staking Pool size

Nodes with a higher reliability score have an increased likelihood of receiving requests, thus maximizing the potential [network reward](/guide/core/vsl/reward/network-reward) received.

Reliability Score is greatly impact by demotion and slashing.
